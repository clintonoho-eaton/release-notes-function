I have a Jira {{$issue_type}} in JSON format conforming to a provided schema, which includes keys, summary, description, and comments.
I need you to analyze the {{$issue_type}} data:

{{$issue_info}}

CRITICAL: You MUST return ONLY a valid JSON object. Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Your response must start with '{' and end with '}'. If you cannot analyze the data, return a JSON object with default values rather than an empty response.

The JSON must contain the following fields:

{{$output_schema}}

INSTRUCTIONS:
- Extract the "ticket_number" from the summary field. It will be in the format of 'INCXXXXXXXXXXXX'. If no ticket number is found, set this field to an empty string "".
- The "visibility" can be "Internal" or "External". Internal tickets reference developer and team processes or tools, external tickets reference customers or customer use cases.
- The "executive_summary" should summarize the {{$issue_type}} in 1 sentence that a non-technical person could understand.
- The "technical_summary" should summarize the {{$issue_type}} in 1 sentence that an expert technical person could understand.
- The "cause" should be a concise summary of what you think the cause of the bug was.
- The "fix" should be a concise summary of what you think the fix for the bug was.
- The "reasoning" should articulate your reasoning for the "cause" and "fix" fields.

Use your discretion to reason the best you can in the presence of ambiguous or conflicting information.

RESPONSE FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:
- Start your response with '{'
- End your response with '}'
- Use proper JSON syntax with quoted keys and values
- Do not include markdown code blocks or any other formatting
- If uncertain about a field, provide a reasonable default value rather than omitting the field

FORMAT YOUR RESPONSE AS A VALID JSON OBJECT ONLY WITH NO EXPLANATORY TEXT.
